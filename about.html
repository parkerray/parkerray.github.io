<p>My name is Parker Thompson and I am starting my learning journey to be a full stack web developer. 
  I have an Associates degree in Computer Information Systems and Technology and a Web Design certification 
  from my local community college, NCTC. I've been an apprentice electrician, Starbucks barista, and a customer 
  service representative at CustomInk. My goal is to become a web developer next, so this is the beginning of that journey.
