My name is Parker Thompson, and I'm starting my path to web development! I'll admit, it's taken longer than neccessary to begin this journey. After high school, I earned my Associates degree in Computer Information Systems and Technology at a local community college. During my college courses, I worked at Starbucks and then CustomInk (where I still work) as a customer service representative. It has now been over a year since I've earned my degree and I've sat idlely by, comfortable with my job. 

Why am I starting web development now? I'm ready to turn my hobby into a career. I'm ready to earn financial freedom through a high demand and high reward job title, doing what I love. This blog will hopefully give insight into my progress to anyone interested, as well as help me stay on course with my web development goals!
