**Why Web Development?**
In college I found a passion in two things: graphic design and programming. I love full stack web development because much like Disney's version of Miley Cyrus, you get the best of both worlds! I've earned a web design certification from my local community college, but I am ready to learn the skills necessary to begin my career in web development. This blog is going to be an insight into my learning journey at Flatiron School, and also a roadmap for my own reference. I hope that writing on a regular basis will help me keep a clear goal in mind through this process.
